     Why having a portfolio ? I think the most valuable thing to consider about a software developer is what he is able to create. How he goes from having an idea to the final user experience. That's why I decided to build this portfolio and lists some of the project I've made.

     In the context of my studies, I built with a friend a website that shows a list of series coming from "imdb.com". Two main parts were developed, the first one is meant for a client, and the second one for an administrator. As a client, you can create an account, log in, then search for series and episodes and add them to your watch list, rate them etc... As an administrator, you can add a new show with the IMDB API and manage all the client's comments.

     In the context of my studies, I built with a team of 6 developers a software able to manage a vinyl collection of a store. In 6 days, we worked in a SCRUM environment with 2 days sprints to deliver to our "client" (our teachers) the solution of his dreams. Developed using C# .NET Core, Winforms and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio for the database, we managed to deliver a working application while learning a lot concerning team and project management.

     Built in the context of my studies, this simple video game actually covered many programming and algorithm topics. For example, I had the opportunity to implement a Dijkstra graph algorithm to determine the shortest path to the labyrinth exit, or from a monster to the player. It also gave me the opportunity to discover Javafx and work on Object Oriented Programming.

     Spartbooks is a mini-project built in the context of my studies using React.js and the Google Books API. It is a one-page application where you can have an overview of different books of a specific author you can search for. This project includes a simple pagination system, form handling and external API communication, all done using React.js.
